Particle: has Euler, Euler-Cromer and Verlet algorithms and calculates kinetic energy, momentum and angular momentum.

SolarSystem: Calculates the gravitational acceleration, updated position and velocity, total kinetic energy, total gravitational energy, total energy, total momentum and total angular momentum.

SolarSystemData: imports data from the NASA HORIZONS interface and makes npys for 3D orbit plots as well as 2D energy and momentum.

SimulationAnalysis: plots the npys into 3 layer 2D graphs and 3D orbit plots.

Testing: tests for gravitational acceleration on planets surfaces and get maxima and minima of graphs.
